 #  'summary': 'In Adong v. Cheong Seng Gee, the Court elucidated on the rationale behind the presumption of marriage: The basis of human society throughout the civilized world is that of marriage. Marriage in this jurisdiction is not only a civil contract, but it is a new relation, an institution in the maintenance of which the public is deeply interested. Consequently, every intendment of the law leans toward legalizing matrimony. Persons dwelling together in apparent  matrimony are presumed, in the absence of any counter -presumption or evidence special to the case, to be in fact married. The reason is that such is the common order of society, and if the parties were not what they thus hold themselves out as being, they would be living in the constant violation of decency and of law. A presumption established by our Code of Civil Procedure is that a man and a woman deporting themselves as husband and wife have entered into a lawful contract of marriage. (Sec. 334, No. 28 ) Semper praesumitur pro matrimonio  Always presume marriage. Here, the establishment of the fact of marriage between Tecla and Eustaquio was completed by the testimonies of the witnesses; the unrebutted fact of the birth within the cohabitation of Tecla  and Eustaquio of four (4) children coupled with the certificates of the childrens birth and baptism; and the certifications of marriage issued by the parish priest.',

The law provides that no  marriage shall be solemnized without a marriage license first issued by a local civil registrar. Being one of the essential requisites of a valid marriage, absence of a license would render the marriage void ab initio.
